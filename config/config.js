    "I graduated from the University og Southern California (USC) in 2021 with a degree in Physics & Computer Science. I kick started my professional career as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. When I'm not working on Amazon projects, I work on smaller projects in different programming languages as a way to learn a new language.",
    "I'm always looking to grow my tech skills as the industry advances as well as improving on the fundamentals. I also enjoy Physics - especially Quantum Mechanics and I hope to one day soon combine both computer science and physics.",
